"""Structured task outcome, for runs started by an external orchestrator.

An orchestrator that dispatches work here has to know how the run ended before
it can decide what happens next — was the question answered, does something need
building first, or is the project simply unable to help? Parsing that back out
of prose is unreliable in three separate ways: the model may not say it, the
wording drifts, and a JSON block gets wrapped in fences. A tool call is
schema-validated, arrives as its own frame in the stream, and the schema itself
is far better at steering the model than an instruction to "end with JSON".

The tool is only injected when the request declares an orchestrator origin, so
ordinary IDE chat never sees it.

                one by its ``slug`` alone — the caller opens it by slug, and a path
                around it only has to be stripped back off.
